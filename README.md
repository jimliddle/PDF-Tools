# PDF-Tools
 A single page HTML file that enables individual pages of PDF's to be extracted locally, with individual pages being able to be deleted and pages re-ordered before saving.

 Pages can be made full screen to analyze contents by clicking the magnifying glass icon, and once in this state the page can be written on (for annotations or signature) and these annotations will be saved out into the new pdf once exported.

As its local it keeps everything local and private. Pdf-lib Javascript ibrary is used as it handles PDF manipulation directly in the browser. Drag-and-Drop Reordering uses the SortableJS lib.

The application uses a CDN to load the library, but the actual processing of your files happens entirely on the local machine.
