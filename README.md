# PDF-Tools
 A single page HTML file that enables individual pages of PDF's to be extracted locally, with individual pages being able to be seleted and sorted.

 As its local it keeps everything local and private. Pdf-lib Javascript ibrary is used as it handles PDF manipulation directly in the browser. Drag-and-Drop Reordering uses the SortableJS lib.

The application uses a CDN to load the library, but the actual processing of your files happens entirely on the local machine.
